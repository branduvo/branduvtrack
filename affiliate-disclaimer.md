# Affiliate Disclaimer

Last Updated: June 1, 2023

## Disclosure of Affiliate Relationships

Branduvo is a participant in various affiliate marketing programs. This means that we may earn commissions when you click on and/or make purchases through our affiliate links. The affiliate commissions we receive help support the operation of this website and allow us to continue providing valuable content to our readers.

## How Affiliate Links Work

When you click on an affiliate link on our website, a small tracking code is activated. If you subsequently make a purchase on the destination website, we may receive a small commission from the sale. This commission is paid by the company selling the product or service, not by you. In other words, you will not pay more when buying a product through our affiliate link.

## Our Commitment to Honest Reviews

We want to emphasize that our reviews, opinions, and product recommendations are always honest and unbiased. The presence of affiliate links does not influence our evaluation of products or services.

- We only recommend products and services that we believe will provide value to our audience.
- We thoroughly research and often personally test the products and services we review.
- Our affiliate relationships do not impact product rankings or review scores.
- We do not create positive reviews simply to earn commissions.

## Identification of Affiliate Links

- This comprehensive affiliate disclaimer page

## Non-Affiliate Content

Not all links on our website are affiliate links. Many links are provided purely for informational purposes or to enhance the user experience without any compensation.

## Your Support is Appreciated

We appreciate your support when you use our affiliate links to make purchases. The commissions we earn help us continue to create high-quality, useful content without charging subscription fees or implementing paywalls.
