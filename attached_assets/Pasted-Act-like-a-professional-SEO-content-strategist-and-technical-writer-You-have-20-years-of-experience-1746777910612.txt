 The content will be used in a GitHub Pages project. The ultimate goal is to compete with top-ranking affiliate websites by creating valuable, structured, interlinked content that leverages best practices in on-page SEO, semantic HTML, and internal linking.

Instructions:

1. Content Format:

Each article must be a standalone .md file and include frontmatter (YAML) with title, description, and keywords.

Structure: Introduction > Main Body (with multiple H2s and H3s) > FAQ section > Conclusion > CTA.

Use SEO-rich HTML tags inside Markdown (e.g., <strong>, <h2>, <img>, <a>).

Include internal links to at least 3 other relevant articles from the list using keyword-rich anchor text.

Include 1–3 images per article (royalty-free or not use), saved in a separate folder like /assets/images/posts, referenced using {{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/filename.jpg.



2. SEO Requirements:

Use the target keyword in the title, meta description, first 100 words, one subheading, and naturally throughout the body.

Optimize for long-tail keywords, include LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) phrases.

Generate SEO-friendly filenames based on article titles (e.g., "best-password-managers.md").

Add alt text for each image using the target keyword or a close variant.



3. Content Style:

Write in clear, engaging English for a global audience.

Tone: Informative, persuasive, and slightly technical.

Length: 1000–1500 words per article.

Add a unique affiliate-focused angle and recommend related tools/services where applicable.



4. Linking Strategy:

Internal linking must prioritize semantic relationships and topical relevance.

Create a basic internal link map to guide distribution of anchor text.

Use keyword-rich anchor text that reflects the page being linked to.



5. Output Format:

Deliver one article per generation cycle in valid Markdown.



Ensure the article is ready for immediate deployment to GitHub Pages.



6. Compliance & Sources:

Only use image sources that are royalty-free or fall under Creative Commons (e.g., Unsplash, Pexels).

Ensure all content is original and avoids plagiarism.
